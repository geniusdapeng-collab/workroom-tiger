# Tiger Global Asset Management (TGAM)

> A fully automated trading system orchestrated by an AI fund manager — covering US / CN / HK markets, running 24 hours.
>
> **No prediction. Process, discipline, audit.**

Tiger Global Asset Management (TGAM) uses the [Caishen AI trading system](docs/CAISHEN_README.md) (v6.3) as its trading kernel and [WorkLoom IM](governance/README.md) as its governance shell, strictly following every trading discipline in the [White Paper: AI Short-Term US Equity Trading (1–15 Day Swing Edition)](reports/AI短线美股交易白皮书_20260730.pdf).

**This system currently runs in paper trading only. It is not investment advice and promises no returns.**

## Architecture: Trading Kernel + Governance Shell

```
┌──────────── WorkLoom IM Governance Shell (governance/, TypeScript) ───────────┐
│ Five-element event store (hash-chain audit) · Fence engine (white-paper       │
│ thresholds → block-level baseline) · Quest orchestration · night-shift watch  │
│ · Approval cards · Organizational memory · site (accountability UI)           │
│ ┌────────── Caishen Trading Kernel (repo root, Python, fully preserved) ────┐ │
│ │ 21-step pipeline · six-layer decision stack (L0 scan / L1 MRS / L2 SHS /  │ │
│ │ L2b ICS / L3 TSS / L4 risk) · SearchHub 6 sources · 7-ring quote fallback │ │
│ │ · zero-baseline discipline · journal → WFA → DSR · paper-trading engine   │ │
│ │ · self-contained HTML daily report · review loop (Zhuge team: daily       │ │
│ │ attribution / weekly checkup / monthly WFA proposal with approval flow)   │ │
│ │ · engineering red lines (LLM irreversibility / passthrough logging /      │ │
│ │ step roll-call)                                                           │ │
│ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Trading kernel**: the repo root is the Caishen system; [original README here](docs/CAISHEN_README.md). The decision stack, thresholds, and risk formulas use `trading_system/config.py` as the single source of truth.
- **Governance shell**: `governance/` is the WorkLoom IM base — governance only, never decisions. It turns every trading action into an accountable event and turns white-paper red lines into a second, machine-level lock. Integration design: [docs/GOVERNANCE.md](docs/GOVERNANCE.md).
- **Industry role bundle**: `governance/bundles/trading/` — AI fund-manager team presets, three-layer fence packs, and investment skills (a stub pointer remains at `bundles/trading/`).

## Quick Start (Trading Kernel)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q          # 252 tests
python3 main.py --demo               # offline demo (synthetic data, end-to-end 21 steps)
python3 main.py --universe full --top 30 --picks 8   # production mode (daily full market)

# S6 review loop & approval flow
python3 main.py --review-list                              # list WFA parameter proposals
python3 main.py --review-approve <id>                      # approve → effective next day, disclosed
python3 main.py --review-reject <id> --reason "..."        # reject (reason required)
```

## The Ten Iron Rules of the White Paper (highest discipline; no upgrade may violate them)

1. **Edge is process, not prediction**: permission first (MRS) → mainline (SHS) → chain prosperity (ICS) → entry timing (TSS)
2. **Deliberately unearned money**: no earnings gambles; no forcing trades when MRS*<4; honest failure when the data foundation is unsound
3. **Hard entry logic**: standard long requires MRS*≥6 and SHS≥7.5 and TSS_final≥7.2; light-probe channel sizes ×0.30–0.40; no new positions when MRS*<4.0
4. **Mechanized risk control**: 1R = 0.8% of equity; single name ≤20%; structural/time stops; profit protection at ≥2R; Kill Switch
5. **Data engineering**: multi-source fallback chain never falls back to synthetic data; zero-baseline discipline restarts every run from scratch
6. **Engineering red lines**: 21-step roll-call — a missing step is an incident; LLM steps are irreversible (no rule-based fallback); exceptions passthrough with logging
7. **Iteration honesty**: WFA + DSR correction; insignificant results keep default parameters
8. **Public paper-trading verification**: fully AI-managed, gains and losses reported truthfully, no cosmetic framing
9. **AI division of labor**: semantics to LLMs, numbers to rules, gates must be deterministic
10. **Consistency**: same input, same output — the premise of backtesting, review, and iteration

## Compliance Statement

This system is a technical research and simulation project: **paper trading only, no real orders**; it is not investment advice; free market-data sources carry delays (annotated in reports). Live trading would require separate integration with a licensed broker and compliance with each market's regulations (US SEC 15c3-5, CN program-trading filing, HK SFC).
